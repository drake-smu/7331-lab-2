# Lab 02 : Classification

You are to build upon the predictive analysis (classification) that you already completed in the previous mini-project, adding additional modeling from new classification algorithms as well as more explanations that are inline with the CRISP-DM framework. You should use appropriate cross validation for all of your analysis (explain your chosen method of performance validation in detail). Try to use as much testing data as possible in a realistic manner (you should define what you think is realistic and why). 

This report is worth 20% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with 
all the code used, visualizations, and text in a single document. THe format of the 
document can be PDF, notebook, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format you 
like, buit it is easiest to turn in a rendered notebook. The results should be
reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step 
in your report.

## Data Selection  

Select a dataset identically to the way you you selected thte first project work week 
and mini project. You are not required to use the same dataset that you used in the past,
but you are encouraged. You must identify two tasks from the dataset to regress or 
classify. That is :  

* two classification tasks **OR**
* two regression tasks **OR**
* one classification AND one regression task

For example, if your dataset was from the diabetes data you might try to predict two 
tasks: (1) classifying if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days, and (2) regressing
what the total number of days a patient will spend in the hospital, given their history 
and specifics of the encounter like the tests administered and previous admittance.  

## Grading

### Data Presentation (15 points)

* [10 Points] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representation. 
Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimentionality reduction, scaling. Remove 
variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis.
* [5 Points] Describe the final dataset that is used for the classification/regression (describe any newly formed variables you create)

### Modeling and Evaluation (70 Points)

### Deployment (5 points)

### Exceptional Work (10 points)

# Analysis  

Do your main work here. We will refine the work here and complile into single notebook at 
end. **SINGLE PURPOSE FILES**! To save on run times and make things more readable, please
 limit the scope of your work per file to one task (i.e. dataCleaning.py, vizualization.py, classification.py, regression.py)  

Lastly, if a step needs to be carried out more than once (same chunk of code is written in multiple parts of file but ran on different data), please make said chunk into a reusable 
function.
